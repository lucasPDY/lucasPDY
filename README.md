### Greetings Traveller ðŸ‘‹ You have stumbled across my GitHub Profile.

Your journey has been long so feel free to rest your head on my profile page.

Here lies Lucas ðŸ‘Œ, currently a Frontend Developer at Corplite Technologies, a tech startup based in Melbourne where we work on some cool contact tracing applications to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy.

Besides work, I dabble around in the crypto and investing space, looking for the new big product to come into the market.

I play some pretty bad Valorant too in my spare time, here are my [game stats](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/TemporalSushi%231142/overview), just for fun.

Hit me up for a chat on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-phangdeyuan/) to find out more info about my professional life! 
I look forward to your DMs!
