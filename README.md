### Greeting Traveller 👋 You have stumbled across my GitHub Profile.

I am Lucas 👌, currently a Frontend Developer/Technical Consultant at Corplite Technologies, a tech startup based in Melbourne where we work on some cool contact tracing applications to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy.

Besides work, I dabble around in the crypto and investing space, looking for the new big product to come into the market.

I play some pretty bad Valorant too in my spare time, here are my [game stats](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/TemporalSushi%231142/overview), just for fun.

Hit me up for a chat on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-phangdeyuan/) to find out more info about my professional life! 
I look forward to your DMs!
